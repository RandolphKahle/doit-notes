# Network Address Translation


## NAT Gateway

Network Address Translation - simply a way to provide isolation and a translation from private IP addresses and the public, routable IP addresses.

## NAT Instances

NAT *instances* are no longer recommended as they are singular instead of a shared, secure, resilient service. (However, NAT instances may still be on the exam).
