According to Amazon:

Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is an S3 storage class for data with unknown access patterns or changing access patterns that are difficult to learn. It is the first cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between two access tiers when access patterns change. One tier is optimized for frequent access and the other lower-cost tier is designed for infrequent access.

Objects uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the frequent access tier. S3 Intelligent-Tiering works by monitoring access patterns and then moving the objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If the objects are accessed later, S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves the object back to the frequent access tier. This means all objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering are always available when needed. There are no retrieval fees, so you wonâ€™t see unexpected increases in storage bills when access patterns change
