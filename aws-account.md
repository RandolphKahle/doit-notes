# AWS Account

An AWS account is a structure which owns resources within
AWS, has a root user, and accumulates charges for the
use of cloud resources. 

When you create a new AWS account you get a choice of support
plans:

* [[aws-account-support-basic]]
* [[aws-account-support-developer]]
* [[aws-account-support-business]]
* [[aws-account-support-enterprise]]



It appears to be similar to a [[[gcp-project]]].

An account has:
* Unique ID number
* [[aws-arn]].
* [[aws-iam-policy]]
